		<h5>How much?</h5>
		<p>Twenty bucks.</p>
		<h5>What color?</h5>
		<p>White shirt. Red and light grey ink. Just like the picture.</p>
		<img class="shadowoverflow" src="images/preview.png" alt="Design Preview">
		<h5>It has an Indian on it!</h5>
		<p>You bet!</p>
		<h5>What sizes?</h5>
		<p>Well before we get to sizes, you should know you should know you have an important decision to make: women’s or unisex cut. Now you may think it’s really easy to decide which one, but not always. For all you beautiful girls (yes, I mean you!), the women’s cut is shaped to be a tighter fit around the waist. But the unisex cut is a classic straight cut, so you may want to go with that if you prefer a typical t-shirt fit, even if you’re a girl.</p>
		<img class="shadowoverflow" src="images/cuts.png" alt="Unisex vs. Female Cuts">
		<p>Now for sizes. These are Next Level Apparel tees. So if you’ve ever worn Next Level shirts before, just go with the size you’re used to. If you haven’t, you should probably know that this might be the softest, most wonderful shirt you’ve ever worn. You should also know that they tend to be a bit tight-fitting. Like a looser fit? I might go with one size larger than you usually pick. No larger size? Exposed bellybuttons are totally coming back in style.</p>
		<p>For both cuts, I'm definitely ready to print on XS, S, M, L, and XL. But if you really want something else, just let me know and I'll see what I can do.</p>
		<p>Oh, and don't forget to check out the <a href="sizecharts.php">size charts</a>.</p>
		<h5>How long do I have to order?</h5>
		<p>So here's how it works. I get these shirts printed in batches about every 2 weeks. Each batch is all the shirts ordered since the last batch was printed. When you give me your order form and payment, it means I'll get a shirt printed in your size when I order the next batch. In other words, you're preordering a fresh-printed shirt. I don't have any ready to hand you right away.</p>
		<p>Anyway, check out the <a href="getone.php">order page</a> to see the next order deadline to make sure you're in the next batch. My last order deadline will probably be in late May so I can deliver the shirts before graduation.</p>
		<h5>How long until I get my shirt?</h5>
		<p>Once the order deadline passes, the shirts should be printed within a week and I'll try to get them out to you in a day or two after I get them, but it might get pretty hectic.</p>
		<h5>Who made it?</h5>
		<p>Jacob Ford, with tons of help from the amazing Katie Smith getting the design just right. If enough of you <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=soudyshirt&text=Yo%20%40unitof.%20Gimme%20summa%20them%20original%20designs%20yo." class="twitter-hashtag-button" data-related="unitof">Tweet #soudyshirt</a>, I just might maybe possibly show you some of the original designs. But only if you tweet it up.</p>
		<h5>Why?</h5>
		<p>Because he loves you very much. And wants to make money.</p>
		<h5>Can I get some legal jawn?</h5>
		<p>But of course! Jacob Ford's Homemade 2012 Souderton Senior T Shirt ("The Soudy Shirt") is in no way affiliated with, sponsored by, or distributed by Souderton Area High School, Souderton Area School District, or any other school district property. In other words, it was designed independently by Jacob Ford, and he is selling it all by himself.</p>
		<h5>How can the Soudy Shirt save my life? <small>(asked by Maddy Cappelloni)</small></h5>
		<p>While it was designed with style in mind, the Soudy Shirt certainly does not lack function in the field of survival. So let's begin.</p>
		<p>First of all, I will assume that by survival, you are referring to survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Because if you don't mean that, you are clearly not thinking straight and you should reconsider your priorities before investing in this tool and wasting $20 on what you think is merely high school class apparel.</p>
		<p>With that in mind, I give you three life-saving uses for the Soudy Shirt. These are merely suggestions to get you thinking. If I were to list all of the Soudy Shirt's lifesaving uses, there would be no point because then both you and your enemies would know the same techniques.
		<ul>
			<li>It is a generally accepted fact that, in a post-apocalyptic world, white shirts are the best apparel one can don. They reflect more heat, they are easily located if lost, and you can play tic-tac-toe games on them with a Sharpie.</li>
			<li>The North Penn Tribe will fear you with the entirety of their cold, dark souls and run away from you.</li>
			<li>The Soudy Shirt looks very nice along with John Hodgman's <a href="http://amzn.to/HK8dyO">That Is All</a>, another staple of one's Post-Apocalyptic Survival Kit.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h5>I got a question so good that it isn't even on here.</h5>
